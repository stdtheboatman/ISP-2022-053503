Queen Bee is an enormous bee with six thousand health. She is summoned by destroying her larva, encased within the walls of Bee Hives located in the Underground Jungle. She can also be summoned by the use of an Abeemination anywhere in the Jungle biome. She is the only source of Bee Wax in the game. Queen Bee is immune to knockback.

Some question?

Queen Bee alternates between charging at the player, hovering above them whilst spawning Bees, and moving left and right whilst shooting stingers. In Expert Mode, the rate at which she charges the player gets faster the more damage she takes.

Defeating Queen Bee will allow the Witch Doctor to spawn; other than this, she does not advance the game in a major sense, though defeating her does provide some decent loot that can further help the player prepare for the boss battle against the Wall of Flesh. One such weapon is the Beenade, which is extremely effective when fighting the Wall of Flesh!
